# Sapphire
Inspired by the deep, timeless brilliance of sapphire gemstones — the rich blue base evokes clarity and depth, while touches of green, yellow and red bring life, precision and energy.
This palette is chosen to reflect both calm concentration (blue) and subtle vitality (the accent colours), striking a balance between immersion and alertness.
Crafted for a workspace that looks poised yet dynamic — where focus doesn’t feel sterile, but alive with possibility.
